      <p>Types of water quality sensors:The water quality sensor is a general term for multiple sensors that measure PH, residual chlorine, turbidity, suspended solids, COD, BOD, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen. Water quality does not refer to a specific day parameter, it contains multiple elements to measure water conditions.<br>
		<h3>1)TOC Sensor:</h3><h4>Total organic carbon analyzersÂ measure the amount of organic, inorganic, or total carbon in water or soil samples. TOC is an important indicator of disinfection byproducts and the byproduct rule requires drinking water facilities to measure TOC removal.</h4>

		<br>
		<h3>2)Temperature Sensor:</h3><h4>Temperature sensors are measurement devices that infer temperature by sensing some physical characteristic (i.e. resistance, emf or thermal radiation).</h4>

		<br>
		<h3>3)Dissolved Oxygen Sensor:</h3><h4>Dissolved oxygen sensor is one of water quality sensor for measuring the concentration of dissolved oxygen in a solution. It adopts the principle of fluorescence
		measurement. The fluorescent dissolved oxygen sensor is based on the quenching principle of active fluorescence by specific substances in physics, does not consume oxygen, and does not require electrolytes. It is divided into two types: seawater and freshwater.</h4>

		<br>
		<h3>4)Chlorine Sensor:</h3><h4>Residual chlorine
		refers to the general term for free chlorine and combined chlorine remaining in the water after chlorinated disinfection and contact for a certain period of time. Residual chlorine is common in water quality sensors.Use to measure residual chlorine, chlorine dioxide and ozone in water. The electrode structure is simple, easy to clean and replace. It can be used in drinking water treatment plants, canning plants, drinking water distribution networks, swimming pools, cooling circulating water, water quality treatment projects, and other occasions where continuous monitoring of the residual chlorine content in the aqueous solution is required.</h4>

		<br>
		<h3>5)Conductivity Sensor:</h3><h4>Conductivity refers to the ability to conduct current in water. In water quality sensors, conductivity is one of the important indicators reflecting water quality. When the conductivity value of the water is higher, the conductivity is better, and the TDS value in the water is larger. The TDS value represents the content of dissolved impurities in the water. The larger the TDS value, the greater the impurity content in the water. On the contrary, the smaller the impurity content, the greater the water. Pure, the lower the conductivity.</h4>

		<br>
		<h3>6)pH Sensor:</h3><h4>The PH value is an important indicator for monitoring industrial wastewater. In industrial wastewater, most microorganisms have an adaptation range of pH 4.5-9, and the most suitable pH range is 6.5-7.5. When the pH is lower than 6.5, the fungus starts to compete with the bacteria. When the pH reaches 4.5, the fungus will have a complete advantage in the biochemical tank, which will seriously affect the settlement of the sludge. When the pH exceeds 9, the metabolic rate of microorganisms will be hindered.</h4>

        <br>
		<h3>7)COD Sensor:</h3><h4>Many organic substances dissolved in water absorb ultraviolet light. Therefore, by measuring the degree of absorption of 254nm wavelength ultraviolet light by these organic substances, the content of dissolved organic pollutants in water can be accurately measured.
		The KH-COD-N01-1 COD sensor uses two light sources, one ultraviolet light is used to measure the COD content in the water, the other reference light is used to measure the turbidity of the water body, and the light path attenuation is compensated by a specific algorithm and can be used to a certain extent. Eliminate the interference of particulate suspended matter impurities, so as to achieve more stable and reliable measurement.</h4>

		<br>
		<h3>8)Turbidity Sensor:</h3><h4>Turbidity
		is caused by suspended particles in the water. The suspended particles diffusely reflect the incident light. Usually, the scattered light in the direction of 90 degrees is used as the test signal. The scattered light and turbidity conform to a multi-segment linear relationship, so the sensor needs to be calibrated at multiple points</h4>
